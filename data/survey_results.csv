New chart shows China could overtake the U.S. as the world’s largest economy earlier than expected

 


	The latest GDP reports show that of the U.S. fell by 2.3% in 2020, while China’s grew by 2.3% amid the coronavirus pandemic.
	The divergence means China will likely overtake the U.S. as the world’s largest economy a few years earlier than anticipated, economists said.As an economic superpower, China poses a clear and imminent threat to the United States, which currently stands as the world's largest economy.



China is set to overtake the United States as the world’s largest economy a few years earlier than anticipated..., analysts said.

The U.S. reported last week that gross domestic product in 2020 contracted by 2.3% to $20.93 trillion in current-dollar terms, based on a preliminary government estimate.

In contrast, China said its GDP expanded by 2.3% last year to 101.6 trillion yuan. That’s about $14.7 trillion, based on an average exchange rate of 6.9 yuan per U.S. dollar, according to Wind Information data.

 





That puts China’s economy at only $6.2 trillion behind the U.S., down from $7.1 trillion in 2019.

“This (divergence in growth) is consistent with our view that the pandemic has been a much larger blow to the US economy than China’s economy,” Rob Subbaraman of Nomura said in an email Friday. “We believe that on reasonable growth projections the size of China’s economy in USD terms will overtake the US in 2028.”

	The Chinese government is committing human rights violations consisting of mass detention, torture, and surveillance, while also challenging countries that criticize it. 
	
	
	China has said that the allegations against them are based on disinformation and lies. 
	
	
	Countries such as the US and UK have responded to human rights abuses taking place in China against the Uyghur population. 

	 
	


The Chinese government is committing crimes against humanity against Uyghurs and other Turkic Muslims in the northwest region of China known as Xinjiang, Human Rights Watch said in a report released in late April, 2021. The Chinese leadership is responsible for widespread and systematic policies of mass detention of Uyghurs and other minorities, torture, and cultural persecution, among other offenses. The systematic attacks against this population have included incidents of mass surveillance, cultural and religious erasure, separation of families, forced returns to China, forced labor, forced sterilization, and sexual violence.  



In a coordinated effort by the European Union, UK, US, and Canada, sanctions have been imposed on officials in China over rights abuses against the Uyghur minority group. The sanctions include travel bans and asset freezes, and target senior officials in Xinjiang. China responded with its own sanctions on European officials, and has denied the allegations of abuse, claiming the camps are “re-education” facilities used to combat terrorism. China said the sanctions were “based on nothing but lies and disinformation.” 



The Chinese Communist Party, worried that permitting political freedom would jeopardize its grasp on power, has constructed a sophisticated internet censorship system to monitor and suppress public criticism. Abroad, it uses its growing economic clout to silence critics and to carry out the most intense attack on the global system for enforcing human rights since that system began to emerge in the mid-20th century. 





In order to maintain and strengthen its control in the region, China targets Uyghurs, a Turkic ethnic group located in northwestern China, with severe human rights abuses.

China's economy has been slowing for the better part of the past decade, but a recent run of poor data has prompted fresh concerns. What is making investors nervous, and how China has responded

 


	Over the last decade, China has experienced a massive and rapid decline in economic output.
	Internal disputes and international conflicts have put a serious dent in China's economic potential.
	A declining economy drastically reduces the threat that China poses to the United States.

 

The world's second-largest economy is expanding at its slowest pace since the early 1990s.

China saw industrial output grow at its slowest pace since 2002 in August.

Weeks later China's Premier Li Keqiang said it would not be easy for the country to sustain growth rates of above 6%.

 

Domestic issues, the US-led trade war, and swine fever are all putting a brake on China's rapid expansion.

 



 

""The slowdown in China is becoming quite significant,"" says Tommy Wu, senior Asia economist at Oxford Economics.

 

""Both the weakening in the domestic economy and deteriorating external environment, including both a global slowdown, and the US-China trade tensions, have a role to play in China's slowdown.""

Given China's importance in the global economy, and its healthy demand for anything from commodities to machinery, any downturn is likely to have far-reaching consequences.

 

Gary Hufbauer, of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, estimates that a one percentage point drop in Chinese growth would probably take 0.2 percentage points off global growth.

	There is good reason to be optimistic that China will become a democracy when one looks at the trends of economic development, cultural change, political leadership trends, and the global environment.
	Intellectual leadership is moving toward liberalism, the traditional media are opening up, and the internet is becoming a cultural arena which the state is too clumsy to effectively conquer.
	The strength of the authoritarian regime in China is increasingly an illusion, and its resilience may not last much longer.

 

China cannot keep moving forward to the per capita income, educational, and informational levels of a middle-income country without experiencing the pressures for democratic change that Korea and Taiwan did more than two decades ago. China’s economy is growing rapidly and mainstream economists see little chance of it slowing down. Democratization has taken place in many economically successful countries including Brazil, Chile, and Spain, coinciding with the classical modernization theory which states that economic development eventually leads to democratization.
 

In regard to cultural evolution in China, Nottingham University’s Wang Zhengxu notes a clear generational shift, with those Chinese born after 1980 having significantly lower levels of trust in the government. Similarly, Tianjin Shi finds that “young people are more likely to endorse an understanding of democracy following the liberal democracy tradition.” Additionally, in recent years, a group of liberal opinion leaders has emerged in China, shifting the political views of more and more young and educated people. 
 

The transformation of traditional media is also contributing to democratization in the country. Despite increasing censorship, more and more newspapers and magazines are exhibiting liberal inclinations. The internet is becoming a tool for organizing political action, and the internet is fostering a general “social capital” which can cultivate a democratic attitude in the long run.

China's military power may surpass the US's faster than you think, thanks to 3 shrewd strategies
 


	China's military arsenal, including nuclear weapons and long-range missiles, is rapidly increasing.
	New technology, including advances in artificial intelligence, allow China to infiltrate US security systems and gain access to classified military materials.
	Through it's use of unorthodox and unlawful practices, as well as its growing power and influence, China poses a clear military threat to the United States.

 

China's military power is quickly becoming the greatest threat to US military primacy. From posturing in the South China Sea to damaging hacking campaigns, the Chinese government is investing more time and resources into its military strategy, and it shows. 

 
1. The Chinese government is hacking its way to new technology.

 
By employing cyber attacks and hacking to steal US military technology, China is circumventing the long, painstaking research and development phase of weapons manufacturing.

 

In January and February of 2018, hackers working for the Chinese government were able to steal 614 gigabytes of information from a military contractor about a secretive US Navy project called Sea Dragon, intended to upgrade and improve current US weapons systems by introducing a ""disruptive offensive capability,"" The Washington Post reported.

 

There are many other known instances of Chinese security breaches; and even at high levels of classification and security, the US government has difficulty controlling the intrusions.


2. China is breaking down US systems.

 
China also works to break down US battlefield defenses. The US high-technology battlefield system — the so-called ""kill chain"" — is comprised of four grids that, working in concert, ""find, fix, and finish intended targets,"" according to the report.

 

The battlefield grids have to communicate with each other — and that's where China's strategy is focused on finding and exploiting vulnerabilities to jam the communication system, degrading an adversary's ability to strike in concert and, hopefully, make those strikes less effective. 



 
3. China hides its hand.

 
All these so-called ""offset"" strategies include some element of capability concealment, to suprise adversaries during battle. The US calls these ""black capabilities,"" kept under lock and key by military and state apparatus. While China may show off some of its capabilities, like the ""carrier-killer,"" as a deterrent, it keeps what some observers call ""Assassin's Mace"" or Project 995 weapons, secret. 

 

Work speculates that these ""black"" capabilities might include ""directed energy weapons, advanced space weapons, electromagnetic railguns, high-powered microwave weapons, or even more exotic arms.""




 

From 1996 to 2015, China increased its military spending by 620%.

America's Awesome Military



The United States has the best military in the world today, by far. U.S. forces have few, if any, weaknesses, and in many areas—from naval warfare to precision-strike capabilities, to airpower, to intelligence and reconnaissance, to special operations—they play in a totally different league from the militaries of other countries. Nor is this situation likely to change anytime soon, as U.S. defense spending is three times as large as that of the United States’ closest competitor, China, and accounts for about one-third of all global military expenditures—with another third coming from U.S. allies and partners.
 

Is America's military the No.1 fighting force in the world?


...looking at other metrics directly related to a country’s war-making capabilities — like manpower, equipment, technology and weapons — the U.S. is not just keeping pace with the likes of China and Russia. Its huge financial firepower has translated into an arsenal and land, by sea and air war-making capabilities that aren't just the No. 1 in the world but No. 1 by a large margin.

The U.S. probably doesn’t rank No. 1 in the size of our military. Data from the International Institute for Strategic Studies put the U.S. at No. 3 in armed-forces personnel, behind population juggernauts China and India. But that says nothing of education, level of training or quality of those personnel.

The U.S. has a near monopoly on aircraft carriers, one of the greatest symbols of military power. Its carriers are about equal in number to those of the rest of the world combined — plus American carriers are more technologically advanced than virtually all others. Not to mention a new $13 billion aircraft carrier that’s about to hit the open seas.

And let’s not forget that decades after the arms race of the Cold War era, the U.S. is No. 1 in nukes. The U.S. has about 6,314 stockpiled and deployed nuclear warheads, according to data collected by the Arms Control Association. Russia comes close to matching that, at 6,082, but no other country breaks the 500 mark.

The U.S.’s tentacles spread far and wide around the globe: It is judged to have more foreign military bases than any other people, nation or empire in history has had.

A report by Credit Suisse in September 2015 ranked countries according to a “military strength indicator,” and the U.S. came out No. 1, handily beating out Russia at No. 2 and China at No. 3. Credit Suisse said in the report that the U.S.’s fleet of 13,900 aircraft, 920 attack helicopters, 20 aircraft carriers and 72 submarines far outweighs the military might of any of its close rivals.



The Reasons Why the U.S. Remains the World's Only Superpower



Military: America’s military superiority remains unrivaled—full stop. The US accounts for 37% of global military spending, and spends more than four times what China, the world’s No. 2 spender, does on its military. The U.S. dominates across land, sea, air and space. America’s Middle East misadventures gave the U.S. military a black eye, but the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan speak more to the changing nature of warfare than declining U.S. military superiority. Terrorists and guerilla fighters give conventional military powers fits by design. The U.S. must ultimately learn to scale down to better meet those challenges. Nevertheless, while conventional military strength might not deter terrorists, it still does a terrific job of deterring hostile nations.



Innovation: Of the 9 largest tech companies in the world, 8 are based in the U.S. Give the growing importance of the technology sector, that’s a big deal. For decades America worried about energy dependency, yet today America is the world’s No. 1 producer of oil and natural gas, in large part due to the development of hydraulic fracturing, a product of public research and private energy. America’s research universities and scientific institutions are best in class, allowing the nation to focus its ingenuity where it’s needed most. And America is spending the money to keep its comparative advantage intact: 30% of all research and development dollars are spent in the U.S.

	With China as the world’s biggest carbon emitter, followed by the United States, some say their cooperation is key to a success of global efforts to curb climate change. 
	Climate cooperation between the US and China is desperately needed from a global perspective, and there are concerns that this collaboration may be negatively impacted by other areas of the relationship.
	The two countries released a joint statement outlining their commitment to cooperate to tackle the climate crisis. 




US climate envoy John Kerry and China’s special envoy for climate change Xie Zhenhua released a statement on April 18, 2021 that said “the United States and China are committed to cooperating with each other and with other countries to tackle the climate crisis, which must be addressed with the seriousness and urgency that it demands.” The joint statement listed multiple avenues of cooperation between the US and China, the world’s top two economies that together account for nearly half of the greenhouse gas emissions responsible for climate change.  



US President Joe Biden has pledged that the US will switch to an emissions-free power sector within fourteen years, and have an entirely emissions-free economy by 2050. China’s President Xi Jinping announced last year that China would be carbon-neutral by 2060, and pledged in March to reduce carbon emissions per unit of economic output by 18% over the next five years. 



Xi stated in a video meeting with German and French leaders that climate change “should not become a geopolitical chip, a target for attacking other countries, or an excuse for trade barriers,” but he did call for closer cooperation on the issue.  









​​​​​​​The US and China must cooperate on climate change policy to ensure the success of global efforts to tackle the climate crisis.
